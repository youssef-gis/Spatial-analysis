* "64.4%" Restaurants accepts Online Order whereas around "35.6%" Restaurants does not accepts Online Order.
* Highest Voted Restaurant is "Onesta", followed by "Truffles" and "Empire Restaurant".

* Most of the Highest Rated Restaurants Accepts "Online Order" and they are, of course, affordable whereas there are some Highest Rated Restaurants who do not Accepts "Online Order" and they are Expensive.
* Average number of Votes for both Categories Varies because the Restaurant who's Accepting "Online Orders", get More "Votes" from Customers as there is a "Rating" window popping-up after each 'Order Place' from the "Zomato" Application.
  That's Why Restaurants having 'Online Order' faciliy has "Maximum Number of Votes" compared to do not ones.
* More than 50% of Restaurants having approximate cost for 2 people is less than "1000 Rs." and they are Affordable too in Bangalore.
* Around "372" Restaurants are "Affordable" as well as they have good "Rating" I.e. greater than 4 out of 5.
